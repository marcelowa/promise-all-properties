# Promise all properties
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcelowa/promise-all-properties.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcelowa/promise-all-properties)

A helper function that receives an object with a promise in each property and returns a promise that resolves to an object with the same properties and the resolved values of the promises.  

The returned promise is rejected in the following cases:  
1. The input argument is not an "object"  
2. at least one of the promises is rejected  

## Requirements
* ES6 Promise supporting javascript engine (browser or Node.js), or at least an ES6 Promise polyfill
* yarn installed

## Usage example (ES6/Typescript):
```javascript
import promiseAllProperties from 'promise-all-properties';

const promisesObject = {
  someProperty: Promise.resolve('resolve value'),
  anotherProperty: Promise.resolve('another resolved value'),
};

const promise = promiseAllProperties(promisesObject);

promise.then((resolvedObject) => {
  console.log(resolvedObject);
  // {
  //   someProperty: 'resolve value',
  //   anotherProperty: 'another resolved value'
  // }
});

```

## Breaking changes

### v3.0.0

- Passing an Array of values causes the promise to be rejected as invalid
- Stricter TypeScript signature now errors on non-object arguments.
